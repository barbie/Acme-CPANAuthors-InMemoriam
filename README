NAME
       Acme::CPANAuthors::InMemoriam - Remembering our fallen heroes

SYNOPSIS
          use Acme::CPANAuthors;

          my $authors  = Acme::CPANAuthors->new("InMemoriam");

          my $number   = $authors->count;
          my @ids      = $authors->id;
          my @distros  = $authors->distributions("IVORW");
          my $url      = $authors->avatar_url("IVORW");
          my $kwalitee = $authors->kwalitee("IVORW");
          my $name     = $authors->name("IVORW");

DESCRIPTION
       This class provides a hash of CPAN authors' PAUSE ID and name to be
       used with the "Acme::CPANAuthors" module.

       This module was created to remember those CPAN Authors who are no
       longer with us, who have given us their inspiration in the form of
       code, to continue and celebrate their time with us.

MAINTENANCE
       If you are aware of any CPAN author that has sadly left us, and who is
       not listed here, please send me their ID/name via email or RT, and I
       will update the module. If there are any mistakes, please contact me as
       soon as possible, and I'll amend the entry right away.
